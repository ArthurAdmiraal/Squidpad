# Squidpad
### About
The squidpad is a Slim Quality Uncostly Intuitive Drawing Pad. These are all the source files. This is an open project, which I'm documenting on [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/7153-squidpad).

### Repository structure
All design files go in the `Project` folder. Any files just made for documentation, such as a diagram in GeoGebra, can be found in the `Documentation` folder.

In both folders, the `Design files` folder contains source files. In the `Documentation` folder, any diagrams of pictures are just in the top-level folder. In the `Project` folder however, files generated using the design software, such as gerber files, can be found in the `Manifacturing` folder. People that just want to have a look at the board can find pdf's and OSHpark renders in the `Easily viewable` folder.
